## Problem Statement:
Healthcare accessibility is a major issue worldwide, especially for individuals in remote areas or those with limited access to medical resources. Our goal is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare resources by developing a solution that enables users to:
1. **Search for medicines** and their availability.
2. **Locate nearby pharmacies** that carry the searched medicines.

This solution will empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health while promoting access to essential resources.

## Project Overview:
Our **Health Assistant AI Platform** is an all-in-one healthcare solution built with the power of **Agent.AI** to enable **Medicine Search** and **Pharmacy Locator** functionalities. The platform allows users to search for specific medicines, get detailed information, and find nearby pharmacies that stock those medicines. It also provides virtual consultations with medical professionals.

### Features:
1. **Medicine Search**: Powered by **Agent.AI**, users can query any medicine, and the platform will return detailed information about it.
2. **Pharmacy Locator**: The system will use the userâ€™s location to identify nearby pharmacies that stock the searched medicines.
4. **Interactive UI**: Developed using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, the platform offers a clean and modern interface.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Agent.AI, Next.js API routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel, GitHub
- **Tools & Libraries**: Axios, GitHub Actions, Environment Variables for API Keys

---

## Solution:
We chose to use **Agent.AI** because of its powerful AI-driven capabilities, allowing us to implement Medicine Search and Pharmacy Locator features without the need for extensive backend development. With **Next.js**, we were able to quickly integrate these features into a serverless architecture, making it scalable and fast.

## Goal:
Our goal is to improve healthcare accessibility by providing a seamless and fast way for users to access medicines and locate pharmacies, especially for individuals in underserved areas. We aim to deploy this project as a fully functional application, ready to be used in real-world scenarios.
